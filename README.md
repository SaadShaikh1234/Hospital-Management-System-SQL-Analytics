# 🏥 Hospital Management System – SQL Data Analytics Project

## 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing a **Hospital Management System** using **SQL** to extract meaningful insights related to **patient care, doctor performance, appointment efficiency, and financial operations.**
The goal is to demonstrate **end-to-end SQL data analytics skills** by working with a structured relational database and solving real-world healthcare business problems.

---

## 🎯 Business Problem

Hospitals generate large volumes of operational and financial data.
This project aims to answer key business questions such as:

- How efficiently are appointments managed?

- Which doctors and treatments generate the most revenue?

- Who are the repeat and high-value patients?

- Where do unpaid bills and revenue leakages exist?

---

 ## 🗂 Dataset Description

The dataset consists of 5 interconnected tables:

### 1. Patients

- Patient demographics and insurance details

- Used for patient behavior and repeat visit analysis

#### 2. Doctors

- Doctor profiles, specialization, experience, and hospital branch

- Used for workload and performance analysis

#### 3. Appointments

- Scheduled visits between patients and doctors

- Captures appointment dates and status

#### 4. Treatments

- Treatments provided during appointments

- Used to analyze service demand and treatment costs

##### 5. Billing

- Financial records of treatments

- Used for revenue, payment status, and financial risk analysis

---

## 🧩 Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD)

- Clearly defined **primary and foreign key relationships**

- Ensures data integrity across patients, doctors, appointments, treatments, and billing

---

## 🛠 SQL Techniques Used

- Basic SQL (`SELECT`, `WHERE`, `ORDER BY`)

- Aggregations (`GROUP BY`, `HAVING`)

- Multi-table `JOINs`

- Subqueries

- Common Table Expressions (CTEs)

- Window Functions (`RANK`, `DENSE_RANK`, `RUNNING TOTAL`)

- Time-series analysis (monthly trends)

---

## 📊 Key Analysis Areas

- **Patient Analytics:** demographics, repeat visits, uninsured patients

- **Doctor Performance:** workload, specialization demand, experience analysis

- **Appointment Analysis:** trends, cancellations, busiest doctors

- **Treatment Insights:** cost analysis, frequency, unbilled treatments

- **Billing & Revenue:** total revenue, unpaid bills, top patients, payment methods

---

## 🔍 Key Insights

- Certain **specializations and treatments contribute disproportionately to revenue**

- **Repeat patients** form a significant portion of hospital visits

- Identified **high-performing doctors** based on appointment volume and revenue

- Highlighted **unpaid bills and financial risk areas**

- Observed **monthly trends in appointments and revenue**

---

## 📈 Project Outcome

This project demonstrates:

- Strong **SQL proficiency**

- Ability to work with **relational databases**

- **Business-oriented analytical thinking**

- Practical experience in **healthcare data analytics**

---

### 🚀 Future Enhancements

Add **percentage-based KPIs** (cancellation rate, unpaid ratio)

Create **Power BI / Tableau dashboards** using query outputs

Optimize queries for large-scale datasets

Add predictive insights using Python or SQL analytics functions
